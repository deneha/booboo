I am experimenting with a **Markdown** file on GitHub in my first repo I have just created named after my cat, Boo Boo.  The Boo Boo repo will hopefully have all kinds of lovely other creations as I get to thinking them up...

Here's a table for example:

Column 1|Column 2|Column 3
---|---|---
A|6|24
B|12|36
C|18|48

Hike!
